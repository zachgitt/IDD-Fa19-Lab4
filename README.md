# Paper Puppets

*A lab report by Zachary Gittelman*

## In this Report

To submit your lab, clone [this repository](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/IDD-Fa18-Lab4). You'll need to describe your design, include a video of your paper display in operation, and upload any code you wrote to make it move.

## Part A. Actuating DC motors

## Part B. Actuating Servo motors

### Part 1. Connect the Servo to your breadboard
**a. Which color wires correspond to power, ground and signal?** <br>

### Part 2. Connect the Servo to your Arduino
**a. Which Arduino pin should the signal line of the servo be attached to?** <br>
The analog pin 9 sent signals to the servo without any issues.

**b. What aspects of the Servo code control angle or speed?** <br>
The angle is controlled by the length of the pulses. While the speed is dictated by the frequency the servo expects to receive signals.

## Part C. Integrating input and output

**Include a photo/movie of your raw circuit in action.**

## Part D. Paper puppet

**a. Make a video of your proto puppet.**

## Part E. Make it your own

**a. Make a video of your final design.**
